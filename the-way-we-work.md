## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is The Way We Work?

This document sets out our vision for the environment and culture within which we wish NHSUK software developers to operate. It also explains how we intend to bring about and maintain that environment and culture.

As such, this document is intended to provide an overall policy position so that the Dev & Test Leadership Team ("the leadership team") can act independently in a fair and consistent way while bringing about the policy objectives.

While we'd encourage all developers and related professionals to read this document, we'd also recommend referring to the relevant Quick Guide in the appendices to see what this policy means for you specifically. 

### 1.2 Why have we created The Way We Work?

Recent surveys of NHSUK developers have told us that in order to do their best work they need a clearer explanation of their roles and more support from the leadership team. This document is our attempt to meet those needs.

The leadership team have also been receiving strong messages from both the Director of Product Delivery, its Head of Engineering, and our own Head of Delivery about the urgent need to re-focus our activities to secure improvements in certain key areas. This document explains the systems which we believe will bring about those improvements.

### 1.3 How we designed The Way We Work

We believe in:

- Growth: Everyone has the potential to improve
- Autonomy: People work best when they control how they work
- Mastery: People work best when they are always learning
- Purpose: People work best when they choose what to work on
- Support: People work best when they are supported by their colleagues
- Structure: Progress is best made within an iterative and incremental system

Therefore:

- We will focus on future growth, not on past performance
- We will ensure individuals choose what to work on and how to do that work
- We will ensure individuals have the time to learn new things
- We will ensure individuals understand their role and responsibilities
- We will ensure individuals at all levels receive the support they need
- We will expand the current quarterly objective setting cycle to accommodate the above

### 1.4. How we will measure our success

The Way We Work will be judged a success if it helps NHSUK software developers rapidly deliver value to users whilst improving the technical quality of our products.

The leadership team will be held accountable for those business outcomes. The Way We Work is not intended to be a way to assess the performance of individuals.

The leadership team has decided to measure their success in 3 broad categories:

- Software Engineering Quality Dashboard
- Individual Contribution
- Team Participation

**Software Engineering Quality Dashboard**

The dashboard contains a number of technical measures for each of our products and we have been instructed to improve those scores.

The leadership team will monitor progress towards improving our scores, which will be achieved by developers completing objectives as part of their 20% time.

**Individual Contribution**

Users are happy when value is delivered continuously and developers are happy when a piece of work is complete. 

The leadership team will monitor how often developers are able to contribute code which is deployed to production.

**Team Participation**

We do our best work when we work together and when we help each other to improve.

The leadership team will monitor activity on Jira tickets.

TODO: Will we also monitor how many pair programming (or mentoring) sessions are taking place?

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Summary

TODO

The new responsibilities acquired at each pay band build upon the responsibilities of the band below.

A developer's "role" is therefore the sum of all the responsibilities at their own band and of the bands below.

However, as developers increase in seniority their general focus is expected to shift from individual work to a whole-team approach.

### 2.2 Responsibility Matrix

The responsibility matrix below shows pay bands across the top and areas of responsibility down the side. The new responsibilities acquired at each role are therefore set out in a columnar fashion.

|ROLE TITLE|Developer (bands 6 & 7)|Senior Developer (band 8a)|Principal Engineer (band 8b)|Development & Test Manager (band 8c)|
|---| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | -------------- |
| **FOCUS** | **SELF** | **SINGLE TEAM** | **MULTIPLE TEAMS** | **ALL TEAMS** |
|**CODE**| Feature Development | System Design and Documentation | Engineering Quality Framework |                |
|**LEADERSHIP and AUTONOMY**| 20% Time | SDMT Operational Planning | Strategy Implementation and Lean Improvement Projects | Vision and Strategy |
|**GROWING THE TEAM**| Code Reviews | Mentoring and Pairing | Coaching | Delegation |
|**DUTY OF CARE**| Buddy to Apprentice | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 6/7 | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 8a and Contractors | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 8b and Contractors |
|**FINANCE**|  |  | Payments to Contractors | Overall budget |


### 2.3 Time Allocation

When deciding what to work on next, there is one simple rule:

> Prioritise those activities delivering the most benefit to others

TODO: Possible alternative:

> "Help others before you help yourself"

This will usually mean a developer working on activities in their own column in favour of activities in preceeding columns.


## 3. Actions & Behaviours

Actions & Behaviours are the things we expect developers to do within their areas of responsibility.

We believe that if developers do these things, and if they try to always improve how they do them, then surely excellent outcomes will follow. 

Note that according to the responsibility matrix above, only some of the below actions and behaviours will be appropriate for each role.

TODO: This section should be "WHAT and HOW OFTEN". Move details to Tools & Methods

TODO: Alternative approach: Combine into "Actions & Behaviours, Tools & Methods" or "Behaviours & Methods" etc.

TODO: The notes here need moving somewhere else

Participation and compliance

- This is a special type of meta-monitoring
- Principals will need to be held to account for ensuring Senior Devs do what is required, and so on

How this all fits with the existing line management arrangements:

- Staff will be asked to document their accomplishments through the course of a sprint
- Staff will discuss and reflect on these accomplishments with their line managers each fortnight after the sprint retrospective (i.e. Tuesday afternoon)
- Benefit to them: This record of continuing professional development will assist them in progressing their career. (e.g. by making it easier to prepare for promotion)
- Benefit to them: ... Need more ways to sell this as a useful thing to the individual and the line manager.

## 4. Tools & Methods

TODO: This section will have checklists to guide the actions & behaviours of staff.
TODO: Remove detail from actions & behaviours section and put here instead.

Tools & Methods are best-practice approaches to Actions & Behaviours.

We believe that if developers follow these guidelines then surely excellent outcomes will follow.

### 4.2 Leadership and Autonomy    



### 4.3 Growing the Team    

What support-related roles and activities are expected of:

- Sean
- Principals
- Jacob in particular (e.g. coaching for Senior developers)
- Senior developers
- Other developers
- DMs/POs
- Anyone else

There are various activities to be distributed amongst the stakeholders:

- Compliance with the process/system itself
- Collecting information (e.g. to measure the success of our approach)
- Filtering/evaluating information (e.g. who deserves praise this week)
- Meetings and interactions (e.g. weekly 1-2-1s, regular discussions with DMs/POs)
- Promotion/Communication (e.g. about the system, but also public praise for individuals)
- Decisions that may need to be taken in response to certain triggers
- Various kinds of support or intervention
- Production of educational or supporting documentation

### 4.4 Duty of Care    

**One-to-One Meetings**

- a primary method of line management
- must take place on the first day of a new sprint
- begin by reviewing achievements against previous meeting's commitments
- then identify the individual's commitments for the upcoming sprint...
- ... which will include Jira tickets from their team backlog as well as 20% time work towards their OKRs
- help the individual to identify barriers to success and think through ways to overcome them
- the individual should commit to completing certain activities/tickets before the next meeting
- does the individual need any extra support to meet their commitments?


### 4.5 Finance







**Coaching support**

- First iteration from October to April will be targeted at Senior developers
- 6 x 1 hour sessions
- Current and specific issues for each developer will be tackled

There will also be some planned content and exercises covering:

- self-confidence
- self-knowledge
- critical thinking skills
- specific concepts related to agile/lean etc.
- the specific roles and responsibilities within delivery teams (DM/PO/dev/etc.)

**Reporting**

TODO

What information will we record and pass up the chain?

- deployment frequency by team/product
- commit frequency by team/product
- pairing sessions by team/product
- objectives and/or key results achieved

How will that information be used?

- to identify praiseworthy team/individual achievements
- to identify opportunities to provide additional support to teams/individuals

**Triggers and Interventions**

TODO

Set out in plain language what will be the triggers for intervention.

Also set out what interventions we will be willing to take, including in extreme circumstances.

Example of "routine" intervention:

- E.g. developer fails to complete any of their objectives in a given quarter
- Discussion to take place with line manager and next manager up to agree what extra support can be provided.
- Line manager maybe also needs extra support? (Because this shouldn't have happened...)

Example of extreme intervention:

- We may wish to consider offering staff the ability to voluntarily drop down a band if they consistently fail to carry out their expected role or to achieve the objectives they set for themselves.
- If so, we'd need to do the work now to identify how we could make that work with HR.
- But we also need a bullet-proof way to fairly (i.e. without bias) establish that this was now the correct outcome, and that we have tried everything else.
- We'd also need to clearly set out how this is a "kind" intervention for the individual, designed to more appropriately challenge them with work they would be able to succeed at. (Optimum challenge)

Positive triggers:

- Note that crucially we need to set out some triggers for positive actions.
- For example, if a developer completes an objective then Sean should mention this in the next update he delivers.
- Plenty of other potential positive triggers: shipping code N sprints in a row, obtaining a new qualification, etc.


## 5. Quarterly objective setting cycle

TODO

This is going to be very similar to the system Jacob already put in place. We can reuse some of the diagrams used to explain that system (in particular the goal-setting and 1-2-1 reviews) because they remain identical.

Need to produce a calendar showing key activities

Monthly-ish granularity i.e. to the level of when devs should be updating the corporate system with news about completed objectives.

# REMOVED

TODO: Decide whether any of the below can usefully be reincorporated into the above structure

## 2. Goals of $THIS

- What specifically are we trying to achieve here.

TODO: Our Values (by definition) should help deliver these goals. Therefore, set out the things below as benefits of the appropriate Value when discussing them in the later section.

### 2.1 Individual Goals

- Promote a working environment conducive to happiness and good mental health
- Help them to do their best work
- Provide optimum challenges
- Provide support as required
- Reward and praise success
- Clarify roles and responsibility
- Clarify expectations to prevent overwork

### 2.2 Team Goals

- Help teams to operate in a more agile way
- Delivery of more value and higher quality to the public
- Better working relations/environment

### 2.3 Organisational Goals

- Produce evidence to demonstrate that our developers are contributing adequately (i.e. protect them from outside interference and misguided attempts to judge them)
- Support the long-term availability of a suitably skilled team of developers (i.e. the team needs to be a "going concern" in business-speak)
- Nurture human capital and retain staff by ensuring the culture is not overbearing
- Better alignment of 20% time work to improving Software Quality Dashboard and ensuring compliance with Software Quality Framework

## 3. Barriers to Success

- What could prevent us from achieving our goals.
- How will we avoid falling into these traps.

TODO: Our Values (by definition) should help deliver these goals. Therefore, set out the things below as benefits of the appropriate Value when discussing them in the later section.

### 3.1 Individual Barriers

- Individuals usually fear and despise any approach to performance management.
- Individuals may refuse to comply with an intrusive process.
- Individuals may believe there is no reward for success, so why bother.

### 3.2 Team Barriers

- Continuing professional development is often disconnected from the flow of work, and therefore gets overlooked.
- Lack of psychological safety in teams may hide or prevent useful feedback.
- Teams are often focussed more on deadlines and delivery rather than in creating the conditions for growth and workforce success.

### 3.3 Organisational Barriers

- May fail to generate the required team capabilities.
- Tempting to get lost in process rather than focusing on culture and mindset.
- Line managers (from Sean downwards) may find it difficult to find time to properly run the system.
